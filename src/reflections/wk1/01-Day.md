In your own words, why do we use Git?

We use Git for organization and consistency benefits. Git creates a repository structure that is uniform and reusable.



What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

The benefits to using multiple branches when versioning from your "trunk" base of code is to ensure that as improvements or changes are branched, code can be restored if necessary.



What is the difference between Git and GitHub

Git is a version control system. 
GitHub is a remote repository.
