What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

A Pseudo-Class is custom created ruleset that can be used to apply different styles or actions to your html. Changing colors of buttons for example or even maintaining uniform sizes for multiple fields.


What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity is a raking system applied to conflicting rulesets pointed at the same element. The selector * for example has a lower Specificity than a .named pseudo-class. The specificity scale follows a 100,10,1 metric.   


What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

Over using the !important feature could make it difficult to implement total page styling changes; like themes, by hard coding styling choices that use this declaration. Other complications from overusing this declaration to force specificity could come up in testing. I can totally see some frustration coming from a forgotten !important tag used and expecting a different result.
