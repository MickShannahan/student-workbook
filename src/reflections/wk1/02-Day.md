What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

A pseudo-Class is custom created ruleset that can be used to apply different styles or actions to your html. Changing colors of buttons for example or even maintianing uniform sizes for multiple fields. 


What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity is a raking system applied to conflicting rulesets pointed at the same element. The selector * for example has a lower Specificty than a .named pseudo-class. The specificty scale follows a 100,10,1 metric.  


What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

Over using the !important feature could make it difficult to impliment total page styling changes; like themes, by hard coding styling choices that use this declaration. Other complications from over using this declaration to force specificty could come up in testing. I can totaly see some frustraion coming from a forgoten !important tag used and expecting a different result.
