What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

Some of the "house cleaning" or code organizing tips that I have picked up have really helped with getting started on projects. Utilizing templates to drop in "header, main and footer" or format on save presets to reorient div tags. Using Ctrl/ to quickly throw in comments for To Do's.

How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

Good design and layout can have a profound effect on the user. A bad design can lead to a difficult user experience; this in turn can cause the user to NOT use your website ever again. However, a good design can lead to repeat use, even attracting more users. 
A well-designed layout and theme can convey a product owners desired goals. For example, if the website was for some sort of calming product, using calming colors and softer edges or borders can reinforce this message and reach the desired target audience.
