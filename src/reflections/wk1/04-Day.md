What is the purpose of wire-framing?

Wire-framing a website allows a project to begin. Essentially this is where a concept or an idea begins to take shape. A wireframe helps to shape the overall look and feel of the website and gives the developer a general map of where content is going to go.

What are the different levels of detail in wireframes and why is each one useful?

Low-fidelity wireframes are basic layout and high-level concept ideas. Mid-fidelity wireframes tend to be basic in nature yet adding some detail into the concept. High-fidelity wireframes detailed layouts of the design.

Do you think wireframes are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

Absolutely worth it! If not just for the idea of taking the time to work up a good wire frame and have the idea turned down, rather than building a whole site and having a product owner scrap your efforts. Also having a "road map" to reference when designing can help keep a project moving along.
